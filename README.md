# R6 Chams - Public source by Igromanru

## Disclaimer
This source code is intended for educational purposes only, to demostrate how Chameleon Models with a "visual check" can be achieved with a more or less clean code.  
I haven't tested it while an AntiCheat was running, nor can I guarantee that your account will not be penalized if you use it.  
Use it at your own risk!  

## Possible detection vectors
- WinApi calls
- Detour hook
- Thread creation
  
<span style="font-size:0.8em;">That said, my code doesn't do anything what would be more risky than other public sources. If you have a way to use other public Chams without getting banned, my chams are as safe as them.  
However, I still recommend to make your own project and to avoid as many detection vectors as possible</span>
